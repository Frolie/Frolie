### Hi I'm Bailey!
I'm currently a CAD drafter at Tercom Construction interested in becoming a software engineer! I am currently working my way through Harvards CS50 and have a good grasp on C and the basics of programming. I have taken a special interest in reverse engineering, emulation and homebrew. I love learning how programs work on a low level and have taken up learning about assembly on the side. I plan to attempt to write a basic emulator after I have finished CS50 and proceed to continue learning more in the future including web development and more.
