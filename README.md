# Hi I'm Bailey!
I'm currently a CAD drafter at Tercom Construction interested in becoming a software engineer! I am currently working my way through Harvards CS50 and have a good grasp on C and the basics of programming. I have taken a special interest in reverse engineering, emulation and homebrew. I love learning how programs work on a low level and have taken up learning about assembly on the side.

## What I'm currently working on
Harvards [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) (Currently finished with C, and am proceeding onto python and web!)

## My Previous Projects
[NDS_AHK](https://github.com/Frolie/NDS_AHK) - Autohotkey script for Lumen's NDS with toggleable autosave and more.

[FTTT_Excel_Import](https://github.com/Frolie/FTTT-Excel-Import) - A python script made as a proof of concept to automate importing job data from weekly customer data into our job data sheets.

## Future Plans
I'd like to attempt to program an NES emulator, learn backend web development skills, and eventually different languages such as Go and Rust.
